# Nx by Nrwl


Nx takes monorepo style development, which is used at Google, Facebook and Microsoft, and makes it available for everyone. In this course, we'll use Nx to help us build a simple app for a company called the Board Game Hoard. We'll create a store site for them using Angular, a review site using React, and an API using express.



Along the way, we'll learn about the three main things that Nx gives us:

- Out of the box configuration of frameworks and modern tools so that you can focus more on your application and less on configuration.

- Easily share your code across multiple applications or teams while enforcing clean integration points.

- Understand the dependency graph of your codebase so that you can run tests or other actions on exactly the areas affected by a PR and no more.
